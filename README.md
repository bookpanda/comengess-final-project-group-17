## Frontend
http-server or other choices (default port: 8080, can be changed in server's .env)

Cannot send some requests from browser to MCV API due to CORS.

Solution: try testing it on Chrome with CORS disabled


## Backend
Before anything, create an empty folder called "spawn" inside "server" folder. This is for shell command zip downloads

pnpm i

pnpm start:dev
